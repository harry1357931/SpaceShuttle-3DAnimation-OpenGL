===============================

This repository contains my Final 3D Animation project in which i made SpaceShuttle which gets launches 
and then gets seperated from it solid rocket boosters. Used OpenGL libraries.

Main File containing Source Code & comments
===========================================
SpaceShuttle3DAnimationMain.cpp

Input Format:

No Input is required, just run the program and have fun

OutPut Format:

Since this program is a 3D Animation project. It launches Space shuttle in Solar system, 
then shuttle gets seperated from its Solid boosters, then shuttle move close to the planets and rotates.
You can view shuttle from different angles by selecting some keys. You will find instructions on those keys,
once you will run the program
